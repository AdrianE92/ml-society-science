  All machine learning problems are essentially decision problems. This essentially means replacing some human decisions with machine decisions. One of the simplest decision problems is classification, where you want an algorithm to decide the correct class of some data, but even within this simple framework there is a multitude of decisions to be made. The first is how to frame the classification problem the first place. The second is how to collect, process and annotate the data. The third is choosing the type of classification model to use. The fourth is how to use the collected data to find an optimal classifier within the selected type. After all this has been done, there is the problem of classifying new data. In this course, we will take a holistic view of the problem, and consider each problem in turn, starting from the lowest level and working our way up.}


\subsection{Simple decision problems}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Preferences}
  \only<article>{The simplest decision problem involves selecting one item from a set of choices, such as in the following examples}  
  \begin{example}
    \begin{block}{Food}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[A] McDonald's cheeseburger
      \item[B] Surstromming
      \item[C] Oatmeal
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Money}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[A] 10,000,000 SEK
      \item[B] 10,000,000 USD
      \item[C] 10,000,000 BTC
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Entertainment}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[A] Ticket to Liseberg
      \item[B] Ticket to Rebstar
      \item[C] Ticket to Nutcracker
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Rewards and utilities}
  \only<article>{In the decision theoretic framework, the things we receive are called rewards, and we assign a utility value to each one of them, showing which one we prefer.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Each choice is called a \alert{reward} $r \in \CR$.
  \item There is a \alert{utility function} $U : \CR \to \Reals$, assigning values to reward.
  \item We (weakly) prefer $A$ to $B$ iff $U(A) \geq U(B)$.
  \end{itemize}
  \only<article>{In each case, given $U$ the choice between each reward is trivial. We just select the reward:
    \[
      r^* \in \argmax_r U(r)
    \]
    The main difficult is actually selecting the appropriate utility function. In a behavioural context, we simply assume that humans act with respect to a specific utility function. However, figuring out this function from behavioural data is non trivial. ven when this assumption is correct, individuals do not have a common utility function.
  }
  \begin{exercise}
    From your individual preferences, derive a \alert{common utility function} that reflects everybody's preferences in the class for each of the three examples. Is there a simple algorithm for deciding this? Would you consider the outcome fair?
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

  \begin{example}
    Would you rather \ldots
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[A] Have 100 EUR now?
    \item[B] Flip a coin, and get 200 EUR if it comes heads?
    \end{itemize}    
  \end{example}
  \uncover<2->{
    \begin{block}{The expected utility hypothesis}
      Rational decision makers prefer choice $A$ to $B$ if
      \[
        \E(U | A) \geq \E(U | B),
      \]
      where the expected utility is
      \[
        \E(U | A) = \sum_r U(r) \Pr(r | A).
      \]
    \end{block}
    In the above example, $r \in \{0, 100, 200\}$ and $U(r)$ is
    increasing, and the coin is fair.
  }
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<3-> If $U$ is convex, we prefer B.
  \item<4-> If $U$ is concave, we prefer A.
  \item<5-> If $U$ is linear, we don't care.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Uncertain rewards}
  \only<article>{However, in real life, there are many cases where we can only choose between uncertain outcomes. The simplest example are lottery tickets, where rewards are essentially random. However, in many cases the rewards are not really random, but simply uncertain. In those cases it is useful to represent our uncertainty with probabilities as well, even though there is nothing really random.}

  \item Decisions $\decision \in \Decision$

\subsection{Decision rules}

\only<article>{We now move from simple decisions to decisions that
  depend on some observation. We shall start with a simple problem in applied meteorology. Then we will discuss hypothesis testing as a decision making problem. Finally, we will go through an exercise in Bayesian methods for classification.}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Bayes decision rules}
  Consider the case where outcomes are independent of decisions:
  \[
    \util (P, \decision) \defn \sum_{\model}  \util (\model, \decision) P(\model)
  \]
  This corresponds e.g. to the case where $P(\omega)$ is the belief about an unknown world.
  \begin{definition}[Bayes utility]
    \label{def:bayes-utility}
    The maximising decision for $P$ has an expected utility equal to:
    \begin{equation}
      \BUtil(P) \defn \sup_{\decision \in \Decision} \util (P, \decision).
      \label{eq:bayes-utility}

  \frametitle{The $n$-meteorologists problem}

It strongly depends on the problem we are actually wanting to solve. In  biometric authentication, for example, we want to guard against the unlikely event that an impostor will successfully be authenticated. Even if the decision rule that always says 'OK' has the lowest classification error in practice, the expected cost of impostors means that the optimal decision rule must sometimes say 'Failed' even if this leads to false rejections sometimes.}

\subsection{Classification problems}
\only<article>{
  One of the simplest decision problems is classification. At the simplest level, this is the problem of observing some data point $x_t \in \CX$ and making a decision about what class $\CY$ it belongs to. Typically, a fixed classifier is defined as a decision rule $\pi(a | x)$ making decisions $a \in \CA$, where the decision space includes the class labels, so that if we observe some point $x_t$ and choose $a_t = 1$, we essentially declare that $y_t = 1$.

  Typically, we wish to have a classification policy that minimises classification error.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Features $x_t \in \CX$.
  \item Label $y_t \in \CY$.

In theory we should simply choose $p$ before seeing the data and just accept or reject based on whether $f(x) \leq p$.
