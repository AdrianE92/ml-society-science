\section{Assignment: reproducibility}

Select any arbitrary machine learning algorithm for classification from \texttt{scikitlearn} and identify its main hyperparameters. Varying at least one hyperparameter, use bootstrapping and/or cross-validation to find the optimal value for that hyperparameter, and report its performance. How close to the reported accuracy do you expect its performance to be in reality? What are the factors that might cause it to deviate?
