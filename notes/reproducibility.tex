  \only<article>{ One of the main problems in science is
    reproducibility: when we are trying to draw conclusions from one
    specific data set, it is easy to make a mistake. For that reason,
    the scientific process requires us to use our conclusions to make
    testable predictions, and then test those predictions with new
    experiments. These new experiments should bear out the results of
    the previous experiments.  In more detail, reproducibility can be
    thought of as two different aspects of answering the question ``can this research be replicated?''}


  \begin{block}{Computational reproducibility: Can the study be repeated?}
    Can we, from the available information and data, exactly reproduce the reported methods and results?

    \only<article>{This is something that is useful to be able to even to the original authors of a study. The standard method for achieving this is using version control tools so that the exact version of algorithms, text and data used to write up the study is appropriately labelled. Ideally, any other researcher should be able to run a single script to reproduce all of the study and its computations. The following tools are going to be used in this course:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{jupyter} notebooks \only<article>{for interactive note taking.}
    \item \texttt{svn}, \texttt{git} or \texttt{mercurial} version control systems \only<article>{for tracking versions, changes and collaborating with others.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Scientific reproducibility: Is the conclusion correct?}
    Can we, from the available information and a \alert{new} set of data, reproduce the conclusions of the original study?

     \only<article>{Here followup research may involve using exactly the same methods. In AI research would mean for example testing whether an algorithm is really performing as well as it is claimed, by testing it in new problems. This can involve a re-implementation. In more general scientific research, it might be the case that the methodology proposed by an original study is flawed, and so a better method should be used to draw better conclusions. Or it might simply be that more data is needed.}
  \end{block}

  When publishing results about a \alert{new method}, computational reproducibility is essential for scientific reproducibility.

  \only<article>{The same thing can be done in when dealing purely
    with data, by making sure we use some of the data as input to the
    algorithm, and other data to measure the quality of the algorithm
    itself. In the following, we assume we have some algorithm
    $\alg : \Datasets \to \Pol$, where $\Datasets$ is the universe of
    possible input data and $\Pol$ the possible outputs, e.g. all
    possible classification policies. We also assume the existence of
    some quality measure $U$. How should we measure the quality of our
    algorithmic choices? 
    
    Take classification as an example. For a given training set, simply memorising all the labels of each example gives us perfect performance on the training set. Intuitively, this is not a good measure of performance, as we'd probably get poor results on a freshly sampled set. We can think of the training data as input to an algorithm, and the resulting classifier as the algorithm output. The evaluation function also requires some data in order to measure the performance of the policy. This can be expressed into the following principle.

Typically, we need to measure the quality of a policy according to how well it classifies on unknown data. This is because our policy has been generated using $\Training$, and so any measurement of its accuracy is going to be biased.}

  \item Original data $\Data$, e.g. $\Data = (x_1, \ldots, x_T)$.
  \item Training data $\Training \subset \Data$, e.g. $\Training = x_1, \ldots, x_n$, $n < T$.
  \item Holdout data $\Holdout = D \setminus \Training$, used to measure the quality of the result.
  \item Algorithm $\alg$ with hyperparametrs $\hyperparam$.

  \end{itemize}
  \only<article>{
    We start with some original data $\Data$, e.g. $\Data = (x_1, \ldots, x_T)$. We then split this into a training data set $\Training \subset \Data$, e.g. $\Training = x_1, \ldots, x_n$, $n < T$ and holdout dataset $\Holdout = D \setminus \Training$. This is used to measure the quality of selected algorithms $\alg$ and hyperparameters $\hyperparam$. We run an algorithm/hyperparameter combination on the training data and obtain a result $\pol = \alg(\Training, \hyperparam)$.    \footnote{As typically algorithms are maximising the quality metric on the training data, 
    \[
    \alg(\Training) = \argmax_y U(y, \Training)
    \]
    we typically obtain a biased estimate, which depends both on the algorithm itself and the training data. For \KNN{} in particular, when we measure accuracy on the training data, we can nearly always obtain near-perfect accuracy, but not always perfect. Can you explain why?}
 We then calculate the quality of the output $U(\pol, \Holdout)$ on the holdout set.
    Unfortunately, the combination that appears the best due to the holdout result may look inferior in a fresh sample. Following the principle of ``data used for evaluation cannot be used for estimation'', we must measure performance on another sample.
This ensures that we are not biased in our decision about what is the best algorithm.

      Consider the problem of comparing a number of different algorithms in $\Alg$. Each algorithm $\alg$ has a different set of hyperparameters $\Hyperparam_\alg$. The problem is to choose the best parameters for each algorithm, and then to test them independently. A simple meta-algorithm for doing this is based on the use of a \emph{holdout} set for choosing hyperparameters for each algorithm, and a \emph{test} set to measure algorithmic performance.}
