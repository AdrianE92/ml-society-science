\section{Differential privacy}
\only<article>{While $k$-anonymity can protect against specific re-identification attacks when used with care, it says little about what to do when the adversary has a lot of power. For example, if the  adversary knows the data of everybody that has participated in the database,  it is trivial for them to infer what our own data is. Differential privacy offers protection against adversaries with unlimited side-information or computational power. Informally, an algorithmic computation is differentially-private if an adversary cannot distinguish two similar database based on the result of the computation. While the notion of similarity is for the analyst to defined, a common is to say that two databases are similar when they are identical apart from the data of one person.}

    A stochastic algorithm $\pol : \CX \to \CA$, where $\CX$ is endowed with a neighbourhood relation $N$, is said to be $\epsilon$-differentially private if

  \only<article>{Typically, algorithms are applied to datasets $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ composed of the data of $n$ individuals. Thus, all privacy guarantees relate to the data contributed by these individuals. 

    In this context, two datasets are usually called neighbouring if $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1} x_n)$ and 
    $x' = (x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1} x_n)$, i.e. if one dataset is missing an element.
    
    A slightly weaker definition of neighbourhood is to say that $x N x'$ if $x' = (x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x'_i, x_{i+1} x_n)$, i.e. if one dataset has an altered element.

  \begin{remark}
    Any differentially private algorithm must be stochastic.
  \end{remark}
  \only<article>{
    To prove that this is necessary, consider the example of counting how many people take drugs in a competition. If the adversary only doesn't know whether you in particular take drugs, but knows whether everybody else takes drugs, it's trivial to discover your own drug habits by looking at the total. This is because in this case, $f(x) = \sum_i x_i$ and the adversary knows $x_i$ for all $i \neq j$. Then, by observing $f(x)$, he can recover $x_j = f(x) - \sum_{i \neq j} x_i$. Consequently, it is not possible to protect against adversaries with arbitrary side information without stochasticity.}
