As an example, when using an internet search engine, we typically see two things: (a) A list of webpages matching our search terms (b) A smaller list of advertisements that might be relevant to our search.

    \begin{example}
      In the case of Netflix and related services, we would like to suggest movies to users which they are more likely to watch, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:netflix}. However, how can we tell which movies those can be? It is probably not useful to just recommend them to rewatch a previously watched movie. We need to somehow take into account information across our user database: if somebody watched mostly the same films as you, then maybe you'd be interested in watching those movies she has that you haven't seen.

      In the Netflix catalogue, in particular, users also post reviews of the movies they have watched, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:user-ratings}. This allows us to ensure that

  \only<article>{As a simple model, we can assume that each person belongs to a \alert{type}. Every type has the same preferences over films. In the simplest possible model, a user of type $c_i$ that has watched a movie $m$ will rate the film deterministically $x_{c,m}$. More generally, we can assume the following model.}
