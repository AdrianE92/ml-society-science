  \frametitle{Linear classifiers.}
  \only<article>{Finding the optimal policy for our belief $\bel$ is not normally very difficult. However, it requires that we maintain the complete distribution $\bel$ and that we also nder some probability distribution $P$. In simple decision problems, e.g. where the set of actions $\CA$ is finite, it is possible to do this calculation on-the-fly. However, the policies that we wish to find might be much simpler than the Bayes-optimal policy. For example, we might consider linear classifiers.}

  \begin{definition}{Linear classifier}
    \only<article>{A linear classifier is parametrised by the matrix $\Param = [\param_1 \cdots \param_{|\CY|}]$}
    \[
      \pol_\Param(a \mid x) = e^{\param_a^\top x} / \sum_{a'} e^{\param_{a'}^\top x}
    \]
  \end{definition}
  \only<article>{Even though the classifier has a linear structure, the final non-linearity at the end is there to ensure that it defines a proper probability distribution over decisions.}

  \begin{block}{The $\model$-optimal classifier}
    \only<article>{Since the performance measure is simply an expectation, it is intuitive to directly optimise the decision rule with respect to an approximation of the expectation}
    \[
      \max_\Param f(\pol_\Param, \model)  \approx \max_\Param \sum_{t=1}^T  \pol(a_t = y_t \mid x_t ) P_\model(y_t \mid x_t), \qquad (x_t, y_t) \sim P_\model.
    \]
    \only<article>{In practice, this is the empirical expectation on the training set $\cset{(x_t, y_t)}{t=1, \ldots, T}$. However, when the amount of data is insufficient, this expectation may be far from reality, and so our classification rule might be far from optimal.}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{The Bayes-optimal classifier}
    \only<article>{An alternative idea is to use our uncertainty to create a distribution over models, and then use this distribution to obtain a single classifier that does take the uncertainty into account.}
    \[
      \max_\Param f(\pol_\Param, \bel)
      \approx
      \max_\Param N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^N
      \pol(a_t = y_n \mid x_t = x_n),
      \qquad
      (x_n, y_n) \sim P_{\model_n}, \model_n \sim \bel.
    \]
    \only<article>{In this case, the integrals are replaced by sampling models $\model_n$ from the belief, and then sampling $(x_n, y_n)$ pairs from $P_{\model_n}$.}

  \begin{block}{Gradient ascent}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Two views of neural networks}
  \only<article>{In the simplest sense a neural network is simply as parametrised functions $f_\param$. In classification, neural networks can be used as  probabilistic models, so they describes the probability $P_\param(y | x)$, or as classification policies so that $f_\param(x, a)$ describes the probability $\pol_\param(a \mid x)$ of selecting class label $a$. Let us begin by describing the simplest type of neural network model, the perceptron.}

  For classification problems, the observations $\bx$ are features $\bx = (x_1 \ldots, x_n)$ so that $\CX \subset \Reals^\nobservations$. 
It is convenient to consider the network output as a vector on the simplex $\by \in \Simplex^\nactions$, i.e. $\sum_{i=1}^\nclasses y_i  = 1$, $y_i \geq 0$. In the neural network model for classification, we typically ignore dependencies between the $x_i$ features, as we are not very interested in the distribution of $\bx$ itself.}
