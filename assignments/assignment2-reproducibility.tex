The purpose of this assignment is to obtain some practice in the art of reproducibility.

\begin{exercise}
  Work in teams of 2-4 students.

  Select an arbitrary classification dataset from \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?task=cla}. 

  Select any arbitrary machine learning algorithm for classification
  from \texttt{scikitlearn} that can be used with this dataset, and identify its main hyperparameters.
    
  Varying at least one hyperparameter, use bootstrapping and/or
  cross-validation to find the optimal value for that hyperparameter,
  and report its performance. How close to the reported accuracy do
  you expect its performance to be in reality?  What are the factors
  that might cause it to deviate?
  
  Write a short report summarising both your methodology and your
  results. Exchange this report with another group of students. See
  whether you can reproduce exactly what they have done. Was it easy
  to reproduce their results? If not, what was the main problem?
